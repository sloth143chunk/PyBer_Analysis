# PyBer_Analysis

## Challenge Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to provide PyBer with:
-	A summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type
-	Includes: Total rides, drivers and fares
-	Includes: Average fare per ride and driver
-	A multiple-line graph showing total weekly fares for each city type

## Challenge Results

The ride-sharing summary showed:

-	The summary shows the different city types: Rural, Suburban, Urban
-	Rural cities have the least amount or rides (125) and drivers (78)
-	Urban cities have the greatest number of rides (1,625) and drivers (2,405)
-	Rural cities have the highest average fare per rider ($35) and driver ($55)
-	Urban cities have the lowest average fare per rider ($25) and driver ($17)
-	Rural had the lowest total fares amount ($4,300)
-	Urban cities had the highest total fare amount ($40,000)


## Challenge Summary

Using the ride-sharing summary and multiple line graph I believe PyBer could take the approaches recommended below to adjust the disparities.

-	There appears to be a large decrease in total fares in May and low total fares in January.  I recommend decreasing the cost per ride or giving incentives during this time to increase usage of PyBer.

-	With Rural cities having the highest average fare, but lowest rides and drivers.  I recommend creating incentives to increase the driver amount, like bonuses or higher pay.  I also recommend having longer flash sale periods to increase usage of Pyber.
	 
-	All three city types have ride amounts that appear low in comparison to the amount of drivers.  I recommend creating incentives to increase total rides overall.  Deals for the consumer or coupons through third party partners like PyBer eats.
